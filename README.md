## Contents of this repository

This repository will contain all of our weeks problems as well as solutions.
Anyone is welcome to contribute solutions, tests, etc. for any/all of the
problems for the week.

None of the solutions here are guaranteed to be right, and if you wrote one of
these questions and do not want the solution easily available on the internet
